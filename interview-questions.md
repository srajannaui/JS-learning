# 1. Walk me through what happens when you type a URL and press Enter?

This README explains the end-to-end process that occurs when a user types a URL into a browser's address bar and presses Enter.

---

## üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ URL parsing and scheme resolution

- Browser checks what type of URL this is (e.g., `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`).
- If scheme is missing, defaults to `http://`.

---

## üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check browser cache

- Browser checks if there‚Äôs a cached response for this URL:
  - DNS cache
  - HTTP cache (cached HTML, CSS, JS, images)
  - If valid cache found ‚áí shortcut to loading.

---

## üîπ 3Ô∏è‚É£ DNS resolution

- If no cached DNS entry:
  - Browser asks **OS resolver** ‚áí resolver queries DNS hierarchy:
    - Root DNS server
    - Top-level domain (TLD) DNS server (`.com`, `.net`, etc.)
    - Authoritative DNS server for domain (`example.com`)
  - Resolver returns **IP address of the server**.

---

## üîπ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Establish TCP connection (3-way handshake)

- Browser establishes a TCP connection with the server on port 80 (`http`) or 443 (`https`).
- If `https`, an additional step happens:
  - **TLS handshake** to set up encryption (SSL certificate verification, key exchange).

---

## üîπ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Send HTTP request

- Browser sends an **HTTP GET request** for the resource:

GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: example.com


- May include headers (e.g., `User-Agent`, cookies, etc.).

---

## üîπ 6Ô∏è‚É£ Server processes request and sends HTTP response

- Server processes the request and responds with:
- Status line (`200 OK`, `301 Moved Permanently`, `404 Not Found`, etc.)
- Response headers
- Response body (e.g., HTML document)

---

## üîπ 7Ô∏è‚É£ Browser receives response and starts rendering

- Browser begins rendering pipeline:
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Parse HTML** ‚áí build **DOM tree**.
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Parse CSS** ‚áí build **CSSOM tree**.
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge DOM + CSSOM into Render Tree**.
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Layout** ‚áí calculate positions of elements.
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Paint** ‚áí draw pixels on screen.

---

## üîπ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Additional requests triggered

- As browser parses HTML:
- Finds `<link>`, `<script>`, `<img>`, etc. ‚áí issues **more HTTP requests for resources**.
- Handles `async`/`defer` scripts, CSS blocking behavior, etc.

---

## üîπ 9Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript execution & DOM updates

- Browser executes JavaScript that can manipulate DOM (via JS engine, e.g., V8 for Chrome).
- May cause additional network requests (AJAX, fetch, etc.).

---

## üîπ üîü Page load complete

- Once all critical resources loaded and parsed:
- `DOMContentLoaded` event fires.
- After images and other resources load ‚áí `window.onload` fires.

---

## üîπ Summary (interview-friendly one-liner):

> üîî When you type a URL and press Enter:
> - Browser parses URL and checks cache
> - DNS resolution happens (get IP)
> - TCP/TLS handshake
> - HTTP request sent
> - Server responds with HTML
> - Browser parses HTML, requests sub-resources
> - Render tree built and page painted
> - JavaScript executes, DOM may update
> - Load events fired ‚áí page interactive

üìñ Use this walkthrough as a structured, step-by-step reference for interviews and discussions.
