# Hoisting in JavaScript

This README explains **Hoisting**, a core JavaScript concept frequently asked in interviews.

## ðŸ”¹ What is Hoisting?

ðŸ‘‰ **Definition:**

> **Hoisting is JavaScriptâ€™s default behavior of moving declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before code execution starts.**

In simple terms:
- Variable and function declarations appear to "move to the top" of their scope.
- **`var` declarations and function declarations are hoisted.**
- **`let` and `const` are hoisted too but behave differently because of the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Points:

- **Only declarations are hoisted â€” initializations are not.**
- **Function declarations are hoisted completely (declaration + definition).**
- **Function expressions are treated like variables (the variable name is hoisted but not its assignment).**
- **`let` and `const` are hoisted but stay in TDZ and cannot be accessed before declaration.**

## ðŸ”¹ Example 1: `var` Hoisting

```javascript
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10
```
âœ… Explanation:
var a;          // Declaration hoisted (but not initialization)
console.log(a); // undefined
a = 10;         // Initialization happens here
console.log(a); // 10

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 2: Function Declaration Hoisting

```javascript
greet(); // "Hello"
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```
âœ… Explanation:
Entire function greet is hoisted so it can be called before its definition.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 3: let and const Hoisting (TDZ)

```javascript
console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
let b = 5;
```
âœ… Explanation:

let and const are hoisted but not initialized immediately.

They stay in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until their declaration is encountered.

## ðŸ”¹ Example 4: Function Expression vs Function Declaration

```javascript
sayHi(); // TypeError: sayHi is not a function

var sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi");
};

```
âœ… Explanation:
var sayHi is hoisted and initialized to undefined.
When you try to invoke it before assignment, it results in TypeError.
