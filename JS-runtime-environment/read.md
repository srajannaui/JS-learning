# JS Runtime environment 

🔹 1️⃣ Parser
First step in JavaScript execution:

Converts raw source code (text) into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Involves:

Lexical analysis (tokenizing input).

Syntactic analysis (building AST structure).

Detects syntax errors early (before execution).

Scopes and bindings are determined here.

🔹 2️⃣ Compilation
JavaScript engines (e.g., V8) use a Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation strategy:

Initially, JavaScript was interpreted, but JIT allows faster execution by compiling JS into optimized machine code on the fly.

Two important phases in V8:
✅ Ignition (Interpreter):

Quickly generates bytecode from AST.

Runs immediately ⇒ fast startup.

✅ TurboFan (Optimizing Compiler):

Monitors “hot” functions (frequently called) using a profiler.

Re-compiles hot code into highly optimized machine code.

🔹 3️⃣ Execution
Execution occurs when:

Bytecode or optimized machine code runs on the CPU.

The Call Stack manages the execution context (tracks function calls, local variables, etc.).

🔹 4️⃣ JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)
A hybrid of interpretation and compilation:

Interprets quickly at startup (Ignition) ⇒ compiles optimized machine code later (TurboFan) ⇒ re-uses optimized code for faster performance.

Adapts dynamically based on runtime behavior ⇒ can deoptimize if assumptions break.

🔹 5️⃣ Memory Heap
The Memory Heap is where JavaScript stores objects, arrays, and functions in memory.

Managed by the Garbage Collector:

Allocates memory for objects.

Frees memory when objects become unreachable.

✅ Common memory regions:

Young Generation: short-lived objects.

Old Generation: long-lived objects.

🔹 6️⃣ Call Stack
A stack data structure that keeps track of function invocations.

Synchronous execution: one frame at a time ⇒ top of stack executes, then pops.

Stack overflow happens if too many nested calls without returning.

Example:

```javascript
function a() { b(); }
function b() { c(); }
function c() { console.log('hi'); }

a();
```

Call Stack sequence:

scss

push a()
push b()
push c()
console.log('hi')
pop c()
pop b()
pop a()

🔹 7️⃣ Other important components of the JavaScript Runtime Environment:
✅ Event Loop:

Manages coordination of Call Stack + Callback queues.

Continuously checks:

If Call Stack is empty ⇒ pulls tasks from Callback queue or Microtask queue.

✅ Web APIs (Browser environment):

setTimeout, fetch, DOM APIs, etc. ⇒ provided by browsers (not JS engine itself).

✅ Callback Queue (Macrotask queue):

Stores callbacks from Web APIs ready for execution.

✅ Microtask Queue:

Stores:

Promise.then/catch/finally callbacks.

queueMicrotask() callbacks.

MutationObserver callbacks.

Drained before Callback Queue is processed ⇒ higher priority.

Heap → Stores objects/functions.
Garbage Collector → Manages heap memory.
Event Loop → Manages async tasks.
Web APIs → Handles timers, fetch, etc.
Microtask Queue → High-priority async tasks.
Callback Queue → Lower-priority async tasks.


# JAVASCRIPT RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT

🔹 What is the JavaScript Runtime?
👉 Definition:

The JavaScript Runtime is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed.
It consists of:

The JavaScript Engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox)

Additional APIs provided by the host environment (e.g., browsers, Node.js)

The Event Loop mechanism that coordinates execution.

---

🔹 Components of the JS Runtime in a browser:
✅ 1️⃣ JavaScript Engine:

Responsible for parsing, compiling, and executing JS code.

Example: V8 Engine in Chrome and Edge.

✅ 2️⃣ Call Stack:

Where function calls are tracked and executed synchronously.

✅ 3️⃣ Web APIs (provided by browser):

setTimeout, DOM APIs, fetch, localStorage, etc.

Not part of the JS language itself but part of the runtime environment in browsers.

✅ 4️⃣ Callback Queue (Macrotask Queue):

Stores callbacks from Web APIs ready to execute.

✅ 5️⃣ Microtask Queue:

Stores Promise.then, queueMicrotask callbacks.

✅ 6️⃣ Event Loop:

Monitors the Call Stack and queues, ensuring that:

When Call Stack is empty ⇒ it picks tasks from the Microtask Queue first, then Macrotask Queue.

---

🔹 In Node.js:
Runtime is different but similar in principle.

Node.js runtime includes:

V8 engine

Node APIs (like fs, http, etc.)

libuv for handling asynchronous I/O and the event loop.

---

# 🔔 Summary :

🔔 The JavaScript Runtime is the complete environment that allows JavaScript code to run and interact with external APIs asynchronously.

In browsers, it consists of:

JS Engine (executes code)

Web APIs (e.g., setTimeout, DOM access)

Call Stack

Microtask & Callback Queues

Event Loop to manage execution flow.

# 🔹 What is a JavaScript Engine?

👉 Definition:

A JavaScript Engine is the program that executes JavaScript code.
It takes JavaScript source code, parses it, compiles it (often Just-In-Time), and runs it efficiently.

🔹 Popular JavaScript Engines:
Engine	Used by
V8	Chrome, Node.js
SpiderMonkey	Firefox
JavaScriptCore	Safari
Chakra (legacy)	Microsoft Edge (older versions)

🔹 Key responsibilities of a JS Engine:
✅ 1️⃣ Parsing:

Converts JS source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

✅ 2️⃣ Compilation:

Modern engines use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation:

Interprets code initially for fast startup.

Optimizes hot code paths at runtime for performance.

✅ 3️⃣ Execution:

Executes parsed and compiled code using efficient machine code.

🔹 Example: V8 engine
V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code.

Uses:

Ignition: interpreter for quick startup.

TurboFan: optimizing compiler for faster execution of hot code.

🔹 What a JS Engine does NOT do:
Provide Web APIs like setTimeout, DOM access, fetch ⇒ these are part of the runtime (browser or Node.js environment), not the JS engine itself.

🔔 Summary (interview-friendly answer):

🔔 The JavaScript Engine is the core component that parses, compiles, and executes JavaScript code efficiently.
Popular engines include V8 (Chrome, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).
The JS Engine alone does not provide APIs like timers or DOM access — those come from the environment (e.g., browser).
